# Deskription to linked list 
#### Avaiable features:
* traverse list
* clear list
* add tail
* add head
* insert node 
* remove node
* count number of elements
* reverse list
* sort 
* extend 2 lists
* slice list

My linked list can contains data with any type.
To achieve this, I used to use __void *__ pointer, which is embedded in every __list_node__ and points to data.

To compile program, just run _make_ in terminal in directory with all files.
To run binary file, just run _./linked_list_demonstration_ in terminal.

The program is divided in 3 files:
**linked_list.h** - header file with definitions of all structures and functions.
**linked_list.c** - source file with implementations of all functions.
**linked_list_demonstration** - source file, which contains __main__ function. There you can see demonstration of work of all features, realised in linked_list.c.
